a little shpeel:

this is a conceptual design project that is supposed to be a metaphor for sleeping pills ðŸ˜´

how it works: 

the user goes through a series of questions (each answer mathematically manipulates two variables (color and pulse/speed) that will determine the end result)

when done, these two variables get passed to arduino and generates a unique light pattern ðŸ’¡
